We sell the homes at our cost with no-interest mortgages to families who are qualified for the program and who have earned or completed their sweat equity.

Our process starts and ends with families.  Our family selection committee works hard to select families that have a demonstrated need, ability to pay back the no interest loan, and a willingness to partner back with Habitat and the community.  This search is perhaps the most important thing we do, and is rigorous and complete.  Once a family is selected, we have a family support committee that assists the family throughout the building process and the duration of the loan, which may be 30 years.  Our Building committee builds the house with input from the family. Donated materials and volunteer labor along with the no-interest loan make a quality house very affordable.  We can build a $150,000 home for under $100,000 by donations of time and money. Mortgage payments are usually $500 per month or less. This is affordable even for a family living off a minimum wage.

WAITING LIST OPENS MARCH 2ND - MARCH 13TH - The Bremerton Housing Authority is closing their Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program January 29th, 2010.  The list is expected to be closed indefinitely.  The waiting list is currently seven years.  Visit the bremertonhousing.org website to see a list of apartment complexes that administer their own ""project-based"" Section 8 programs, as well as other affordable-housing help that may be available in the community.

Section 8 is a federally funded Housing Assistance Program which offers rental assistance (subsidy) for Elderly, Disabled and Single Families who qualify under the very low-income guidelines.  The Housing Authority administers this program under the regulations and guidelines of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  The Housing Authority currently offers the Housing Choice Voucher Program which has been successful because it provides the participant with the opportunity to choose the type of rental unit and neighborhood that will meet their interests and needs.  Families may also take their housing assistance with them when they move which enables participants to pursue employment and educational opportunities, to be reunited with their friends and family, and to live in a better climate.

The recipient of the Housing Choice Voucher has up to two months to find a rental unit within the BHA operational boundaries for the size unit for which he/she is eligible. The owner/manager of the rental unit then contacts BHA and is briefed about the program to determine if he or she wishes to participate.

The BHA's representative will then physically inspect the unit in question to ensure that it meets the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD's) Housing Quality Standards (HQS). After the unit is accepted by BHA, the rent is negotiated with the owner, and the rent must be within the Payment Standard published by the federal government for this area. The leases are executed for a minimum of six months, and the lease is between the owner/manager and the tenant. The tenant will then pay directly to the owner/manager their portion of the rent, which must not exceed 40% of their adjusted gross monthly income. Under a Housing Assistance Payment Contract (HAP), which is between the BHA and the owner/manager, a check is issued by BHA on the first of each month for the balance of the contract rent owed.","For elderly, disabled, and single families that do not exceed the low-income limit (80% of area median income based on family size) as established by the HUD.",shawes@bremertonhousing.org,None.,,"==  SECTION 8 LOTTERY ==

Services include: assistance in filing for temporary domestic violence protection orders, information and referral to social service agencies, domestic violence information, advocacy, court preparation and accompaniment to full order hearings.  A DV protection order is a two part process which includes the filing of a temporary order and then a full protection order entered approximately 14 days later, if granted by the court.

Temporary Domestic Violence Protection Order: 
A civil order that restrains the abuser (respondent) from committing further acts of assault or violence against the person who has been victimized (petitioner). The petitioner (person seeking protection) must fill out a packet of forms that include providing a description of the acts of domestic violence that have occurred and the protections they are seeking.  They will be asked to describe the most recent incident of domestic violence or fear of imminent harm and a history of any other incidents of domestic violence.  Upon filing, the Petitioner should be prepared to provide the respondent's home and/or work address and birth date to help ensure that Law Enforcement can enter and serve the order on the respondent.  A judge or commissioner will review the paperwork, ask questions, and decide whether or not to grant the temporary order (for 14 days). 

Full Domestic Violence Protection Order: 
An order that is granted after the court determines by a ""preponderance of evidence"" that domestic violence has occurred.  At the full hearing, the Judge will give both parties (petitioner and respondent) the chance to talk about the allegations of domestic violence and whether the order should be granted or not.  The full order can be in effect for one year or longer, in some cases.  The process to obtain the full order may last for two to four hours, but the actual full hearing itself may only be about 15 to 30 minutes.

Any time prior to the expiration date, the petitioner may return to court and request that the order be modified (to be made more or less restrictive) or terminated. The petitioner may also request a renewal of the full order up to three months before its expiration date.

Other Types of Orders: (program does not provide assistance on these orders)

Criminal No Contact Order: This order is issued by the court in a criminal case involving domestic violence. An arrest or charges must be filed against the abuser for this type of order to be entered. If charges are pending, contact the court that is hearing the case to ensure that a No Contact order is issued.  Sometimes victims of domestic violence have a criminal no contact order AND a domestic violence protection order.

Restraining Order: This type of civil order can only be filed as a part of another family law action, such as: a divorce (dissolution), legal separation, or child custody case. These orders are optional but can be obtained in addition to a domestic violence protection order, if necessary.

Anti-harassment Order: This civil order is for situations involving a ""continual course of conduct"" or pattern of behavior, that is unlawful or harassing.  Like the domestic violence protection order, it is a two part process.","

Services include: assistance in filing for temporary domestic violence protection orders, information and referral to social service agencies, domestic violence information, advocacy, court preparation and accompaniment to full order hearings.  A DV protection order is a two part process which includes the filing of a temporary order and then a full protection order entered approximately 14 days later, if granted by the court.

Temporary Domestic Violence Protection Order: 
A civil order that restrains the abuser (respondent) from committing further acts of assault or violence against the person who has been victimized (petitioner). The petitioner (person seeking protection) must fill out a packet of forms that include providing a description of the acts of domestic violence that have occurred and the protections they are seeking.  They will be asked to describe the most recent incident of domestic violence or fear of imminent harm and a history of any other incidents of domestic violence.  Upon filing, the Petitioner should be prepared to provide the respondent's home and/or work address and birth date to help ensure that Law Enforcement can enter and serve the order on the respondent.  A judge or commissioner will review the paperwork, ask questions, and decide whether or not to grant the temporary order (for 14 days). 

Full Domestic Violence Protection Order: 
An order that is granted after the court determines by a ""preponderance of evidence"" that domestic violence has occurred.  At the full hearing, the Judge will give both parties (petitioner and respondent) the chance to talk about the allegations of domestic violence and whether the order should be granted or not.  The full order can be in effect for one year or longer, in some cases.  The process to obtain the full order may last for two to four hours, but the actual full hearing itself may only be about 15 to 30 minutes.

Any time prior to the expiration date, the petitioner may return to court and request that the order be modified (to be made more or less restrictive) or terminated. The petitioner may also request a renewal of the full order up to three months before its expiration date.

Other Types of Orders: (program does not provide assistance on these orders)

Criminal No Contact Order: This order is issued by the court in a criminal case involving domestic violence. An arrest or charges must be filed against the abuser for this type of order to be entered. If charges are pending, contact the court that is hearing the case to ensure that a No Contact order is issued.  Sometimes victims of domestic violence have a criminal no contact order AND a domestic violence protection order.

Restraining Order: This type of civil order can only be filed as a part of another family law action, such as: a divorce (dissolution), legal separation, or child custody case. These orders are optional but can be obtained in addition to a domestic violence protection order, if necessary.

Anti-harassment Order: This civil order is for situations involving a ""continual course of conduct"" or pattern of behavior, that is unlawful or harassing.  Like the domestic violence protection order, it is a two part process.","

Whenever you need help, one press of your lightweight, waterproof help button activates a small in-home unit called a communicator. It puts you in touch with a caring Lifeline monitor, who talks to you to find out what kind of help you need. 

The monitor will call one of your friends, neighbors or relatives, who will come to your home to check on you. If you need more professional help, your monitor will call for it immediately. And, if you press your button and can't speak, your Lifeline monitor knows exactly what to do. 

Lifeline takes the time to learn all about you, so when you press your help button, the highly trained Lifeline monitor who answers your call knows your special needs and interests before you say a word.

The borrower must first qualify for the program based on household income. Next, the City will perform a home inspection with a professional Construction Manager. The Construction Manager and the City will determine which home repairs fit the Program's goals and priorities, and are eligible for Program financing. The City's ""second mortgage"" rehabilitation loan will then be used to pay the materials, labor, and certain management costs of the project. The maximum loan is $20,000 with 3% or 5% interest depending on homeowner income. Principal and interest are deferred for 15 years. A loan becomes due prior to the 15 year term in the event of sale, transfer of ownership, or change of use of the property.

Existing owner-occupied single-family residences within the Bremerton city limits are eligible for rehabilitation under this program. Owner occupied duplex or property with one accessory rental unit may qualify under the program, and will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.  Mobile homes are not eligible. Manufactured homes permitted under Bremerton Municipal Code are eligible.

Rehabilitation activities are prioritized by:
Improvements and repairs vital to health and safety of occupant(s)
Major housing system repairs -- plumbing, electric, heating, structural (eg: roofing)
Certain exterior cosmetic improvements to address blighting conditions
Repairs must seek to address energy efficiency in a cost effective manner when possible
All repairs must be occupant appropriate
Any pre-1978 structure will be assessed for lead presence; lead-safe practices will be followed in rehabilitation areas if required
Ineligible rehabilitation activities include, but are not limited to:
Purchase of moveable fixtures, furniture, etc, that are not part of the housing structure or major housing systems
Non-essential luxury upgrades or unnecessary cosmetic/decorative improvements which increase the project's materials or labor costs
Purchase, repair or maintenance of non-essential appliances or housing systems

Services include: assistance in filing for temporary domestic violence protection orders, information and referral to social service agencies, domestic violence information, advocacy, court preparation and accompaniment to full order hearings.  A DV protection order is a two part process which includes the filing of a temporary order and then a full protection order entered approximately 14 days later, if granted by the court.

Temporary Domestic Violence Protection Order: 
A civil order that restrains the abuser (respondent) from committing further acts of assault or violence against the person who has been victimized (petitioner). The petitioner (person seeking protection) must fill out a packet of forms that include providing a description of the acts of domestic violence that have occurred and the protections they are seeking.  They will be asked to describe the most recent incident of domestic violence or fear of imminent harm and a history of any other incidents of domestic violence.  Upon filing, the Petitioner should be prepared to provide the respondent's home and/or work address and birth date to help ensure that Law Enforcement can enter and serve the order on the respondent.  A judge or commissioner will review the paperwork, ask questions, and decide whether or not to grant the temporary order (for 14 days). 

Full Domestic Violence Protection Order: 
An order that is granted after the court determines by a ""preponderance of evidence"" that domestic violence has occurred.  At the full hearing, the Judge will give both parties (petitioner and respondent) the chance to talk about the allegations of domestic violence and whether the order should be granted or not.  The full order can be in effect for one year or longer, in some cases.  The process to obtain the full order may last for two to four hours, but the actual full hearing itself may only be about 15 to 30 minutes.

Any time prior to the expiration date, the petitioner may return to court and request that the order be modified (to be made more or less restrictive) or terminated. The petitioner may also request a renewal of the full order up to three months before its expiration date.

Other Types of Orders: (program does not provide assistance on these orders)

Criminal No Contact Order: This order is issued by the court in a criminal case involving domestic violence. An arrest or charges must be filed against the abuser for this type of order to be entered. If charges are pending, contact the court that is hearing the case to ensure that a No Contact order is issued.  Sometimes victims of domestic violence have a criminal no contact order AND a domestic violence protection order.

Restraining Order: This type of civil order can only be filed as a part of another family law action, such as: a divorce (dissolution), legal separation, or child custody case. These orders are optional but can be obtained in addition to a domestic violence protection order, if necessary.

Anti-harassment Order: This civil order is for situations involving a ""continual course of conduct"" or pattern of behavior, that is unlawful or harassing.  Like the domestic violence protection order, it is a two part process.","

Provides an ATM/debit-like card used to access food benefits to eligible low-income households.

Food Stamp guidelines are as follows:

1. Exempt goods: Paper products, soap, cigarettes, pet food or other non-edible household items may not be purchased with food stamps. Alcoholic beverages are also exempt.

2. Time limits: Benefits do not expire and may be used at any time.

3. Expedited service: Households defined as destitute and having little net monthly income or resources may be eligible for expedited service, i.e. they may be able to pick up their benefits no later than the fifth day following application if they are eligible for benefits.

DSHS can replace EBT benefits for recipients of Washington's Basic Food program if food was lost due to a household disaster or misfortune, including events such as a house fire, long-term power outage, or other weather-related mishaps that were beyond the customer's control. For DSHS to replace the benefits, the customer must report the loss within 10 days from the date the loss occurred. DSHS will replace the value of the amount of food lost in the disaster, up to the total amount of the customer's monthly allotment of Basic Food.

1220,553,,,,"Mediation is one way that people can resolve their conflicts and still maintain or improve the quality of the relationship with the other person. In a family, a business environment, or in small towns, this can be especially important. 

What you can expect in a mediation session:
  Trained certified mediators to guide you through the mediation process and the expectation of the mediation
  To keep the communication productive and focused on the issue the mediator will outline what it means to mediate in good faith
  Time to tell all parties your story, how you feel, and how you would like to resolve the issues
  Time to listen and hear the other partiesâ€™ stories, how they feel, and how they would like to resolve the issues
  Work together to outline a list of items you would like resolved
  Talk to each other and come to mutually agreeable solutions 
  Design your own settlement agreements that are long lasting
 
Mediation sessions can last up to 3 hours, and parties can schedule multiple session based on their own needs. 
 
Parenting Plan Creation and Parenting Plan Modifications
In the state of Washington, parents are required to have a ""Parenting Plan"" before a judge will grant a divorce.  In Mediation the parents can work together in the best interest of the children, work through historical issues, and work towards healthy communication and respectful relationship.  Additionally, parents will have the opportunity to design their parenting plan that looks to the future; identifying potential changes in their lives: i.e. new partners, residential transfers, children's changing needs. 
 
When parents' communication is ineffective, children suffer in school, in peer relationships and in self esteem. Unresolved conflict is expensive.
 
Business Mediation
Mediation is an effective and efficient process to help resolve employment disputes. A neutral mediator can assist parties in reaching a voluntary, negotiated agreement. Choosing mediation to resolve employment disputes promotes a better work environment, reduces costs and brings satisfaction for both the employer and the employee.   According to Halvorson Human Resources, the cost of turnover ranges from approximately 3 months pay for an hourly worker to $145,000 for a hi-tech employee.  Conflict is expensive.

Dental services started on the Reservation in the late '70s in a small dental clinic located outside of the Tribal business office. All health services were combined into the current medical/dental center; originally the Tribe's gym.

Each client has individual needs which are identified and addressed.  Any one of the following approaches may be chosen, or any combination of healing modalities.

Talking and Listening
The very heart of psychotherapy is the experience of a safe place in which to be heard and seen exactly as you are.  Complete confidentiality and a gentle, compassionate therapist provide that safety.

Hypnobehavioral Therapy
Clinical hypnotherapy should not be mistaken for the antics of stage hypnosis done for entertainment!  It is also unlike treatment by a practitioner trained only in hypnosis, which relies on the power of suggestion alone.  Instead, it is an interactive therapy that combines the knowledge of psychotherapy with the physiological state of hypnosis.  Hypnobehavioral therapy is a relaxing, empowering depth therapy which makes it possible to quickly release blocks and self-defeating patterns of behavior.  You will not be ""in the power of"" the therapist, but will interact with the therapist while in a deeply relaxed expanded state of consciousness.  Hypnotherapy is especially effective in cases of phobias, sexual abuse, eating disorders, smoking cessation, and cases where a conscious mind/body connection may enhance physical healing. It can also be applied powerfully as an intervention in couples work.","Focuses primarily on adults, but will see adolescents.",shaktidst@gmail.com,"Accepts a sliding scale fee and most insurances.

Based on the vocational goals of the participant, our professional job developers seek out employment situations that meet the specific needs of the individual. In many cases, jobs can be discovered after an analysis indicates that certain tasks can be grouped together to establish a position that meets the particular skills and strengths of the participant. For example, a business may have an office environment in which employees must do their own copying. By setting up a position that enables copying to be accomplished for the entire office, an individual who might once have been seen as having limited skills can learn to perform the duties. This becomes a time-saver for the organization and enables other employees to be more efficient in their primary responsibilities a win-win situation for everyone.

After a position is secured, skilled job coaches set up a training plan for the new employee. The intensive training phase continues until the employee learns the job and is stable in his or her position.

Training is provided to co-workers to increase their ability to support the new employee. Comments about improvements in work place morale and a greater sense of teamwork among staff members are just some of the favorable remarks weâ€™ve received from employers involved with the Individual Supported Employment program through Morningside.

Children enrolled receive a developmental screening, an individualized learning plan, at least two meals each day and an active learning experience on days they attend the center.  In addition to children services, each family enrolled receives support in accessing medical and dental care for their child, parenting education, home visits and help with finding needed services or resources in the community.

Head Start/Early Head Start
Head Start and Early Head Start programs promote school readiness by enhancing the social and cognitive development of children through the provision of educational, health, nutritional, social and other services to enrolled children and families.  The program strives to engage parents in their childrenâ€™s leaning and help them in making progress toward their educational, literacy and employment goals.  Additionally, the Early Head Start program promotes healthy prenatal outcomes, promotes healthy family functioning, and strengthens the development of infants and toddlers.

Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program (ECEAP)
The Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program is a whole-child, family-focused pre-school program designed to help low-income and at-risk children and their families succeed in school and life.  Because of the many factors that affect a childâ€™s learning ability and development, ECEAP has four interactive components.  They are: learning in a pre-school setting, health screening and assistance with follow-up medical and dental care, healthy snacks and meals, and family support including help accessing resources and social service.

The Washington Youth Academy is a quasi-military training and mentoring program for at-risk youth. The goal of the program is to give youth a second chance to become responsible and productive citizens by helping them improve their life skills, education levels, and employment potential.  

The program incorporates a highly structured format, with an emphasis on student discipline and personal responsibility to provide a positive, safe, and secure learning environment. 
 
Pre-Challenge Phase
The first two weeks of the program is the Pre-Challenge phase. Candidates are assessed to determine their potential for successfully completing the program. Candidates learn to adjust to the physical, mental, and social discipline of the program. The focus is on leadership, teamwork, code of conduct, and physical fitness training. Candidates who successfully complete the Pre-Challenge Phase will earn the distinction of becoming a WYA cadet and proceed to the Challenge Phase, also known as the Residential Phase.
 
Residential Phase
The 20 week Residential Phase provides cadets opportunities to make basic lifestyle changes that are approached through a rigorous program of education, training, and service to community. Cadets focus on eight core components that develop the whole person in terms of mind, body and personal values. Emphasis is on self-discipline, self-esteem, education and development of healthy lifestyles. Cadets are matched with a caring, adult, volunteer mentor from their home community who works to support and encourage the youth's development of an action plan.  A cadet's action plan outlines their personal education, career, housing, and transportation goals for the next phase of the program.


Post-Residential Phase
After cadets graduate from the Residential Phase, they return to their communities. Graduates continue to build upon their relationship with their established mentor who serves as a positive role model for the next 12 months and beyond. Mentors are committed to helping WYA graduates achieve their post-graduation goals.","Youth 16-18 years of age who have dropped our of school, been expelled, or are at-risk of dropping out.

Provides an ATM/debit-like card used to access food benefits to eligible low-income households.

Food Stamp guidelines are as follows:

1. Exempt goods: Paper products, soap, cigarettes, pet food or other non-edible household items may not be purchased with food stamps. Alcoholic beverages are also exempt.

2. Time limits: Benefits do not expire and may be used at any time.

3. Expedited service: Households defined as destitute and having little net monthly income or resources may be eligible for expedited service, i.e. they may be able to pick up their benefits no later than the fifth day following application if they are eligible for benefits.

DSHS can replace EBT benefits for recipients of Washington's Basic Food program if food was lost due to a household disaster or misfortune, including events such as a house fire, long-term power outage, or other weather-related mishaps that were beyond the customer's control. For DSHS to replace the benefits, the customer must report the loss within 10 days from the date the loss occurred. DSHS will replace the value of the amount of food lost in the disaster, up to the total amount of the customer's monthly allotment of Basic Food.

S. Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Maria Contreras-Sweet announced today.  SBA acted under its own authority to declare a disaster in response to a request SBA received from Gov. Jay Inslee on January 27.

The disaster declaration makes SBA assistance available in Grays Harbor, Jefferson, Lewis, Mason, Pacific and Thurston counties.

Businesses of any size and private nonprofit organizations may borrow up to $2 million to repair or replace damaged or destroyed real estate, machinery and equipment, inventory, and other business assets.  SBA can also lend additional funds to homeowners and businesses to help with the cost of improvements to protect, prevent or minimize the same type of disaster damage from occurring in the future.

For small businesses, small agricultural cooperatives, small businesses engaged in aquaculture, and most private nonprofit organizations of any size, SBA offers Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs) to help meet working capital needs caused by the disaster.  EIDL assistance is available regardless of whether the business suffered any property damage.

Disaster loans up to $200,000 are available to homeowners to repair or replace damaged or destroyed real estate.  Homeowners and renters are eligible for up to $40,000 to repair or replace damaged or destroyed personal property.

Interest rates can be as low as 4 percent for businesses, 2.625 percent for private nonprofit organizations and 1.938 percent for homeowners and renters with terms up to 30 years.  Loan amounts and terms are set by SBA and are based on each applicant's financial condition.

Applicants may apply online using the Electronic Loan Application (ELA) via SBA's secure website at https://disasterloan.sba.gov/ela.  

Disaster loan information and application forms are also available from SBA's Customer Service Center by calling (800) 659-2955 or emailing disastercustomerservice@sba.gov.  Individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing may call (800) 877-8339.  For more information about SBA's disaster assistance programs, visit http://www.sba.gov/disaster.

2126,1055,,,,"Provides advocacy services to victims of domestic violence.  Services include: assistance in filing for temporary domestic violence protection orders, information and referral to social service agencies, domestic violence information, advocacy, court preparation and accompaniment to full order hearings.  A DV protection order is a two part process which includes the filing of a temporary order and then a full protection order entered approximately 14 days later, if granted by the court.

Temporary Domestic Violence Protection Order: 
A civil order that restrains the abuser (respondent) from committing further acts of assault or violence against the person who has been victimized (petitioner). The petitioner (person seeking protection) must fill out a packet of forms that include providing a description of the acts of domestic violence that have occurred and the protections they are seeking.  They will be asked to describe the most recent incident of domestic violence or fear of imminent harm and a history of any other incidents of domestic violence.  Upon filing, the Petitioner should be prepared to provide the respondent's home and/or work address and birth date to help ensure that Law Enforcement can enter and serve the order on the respondent.  A judge or commissioner will review the paperwork, ask questions, and decide whether or not to grant the temporary order (for 14 days). 

Full Domestic Violence Protection Order: 
An order that is granted after the court determines by a ""preponderance of evidence"" that domestic violence has occurred.  At the full hearing, the Judge will give both parties (petitioner and respondent) the chance to talk about the allegations of domestic violence and whether the order should be granted or not.  The full order can be in effect for one year or longer, in some cases.  The process to obtain the full order may last for two to four hours, but the actual full hearing itself may only be about 15 to 30 minutes.

Any time prior to the expiration date, the petitioner may return to court and request that the order be modified (to be made more or less restrictive) or terminated. The petitioner may also request a renewal of the full order up to three months before its expiration date.

Other Types of Orders: (program does not provide assistance on these orders)

Criminal No Contact Order: This order is issued by the court in a criminal case involving domestic violence. An arrest or charges must be filed against the abuser for this type of order to be entered. If charges are pending, contact the court that is hearing the case to ensure that a No Contact order is issued.  Sometimes victims of domestic violence have a criminal no contact order AND a domestic violence protection order.

Restraining Order: This type of civil order can only be filed as a part of another family law action, such as: a divorce (dissolution), legal separation, or child custody case. These orders are optional but can be obtained in addition to a domestic violence protection order, if necessary.

Anti-harassment Order: This civil order is for situations involving a ""continual course of conduct"" or pattern of behavior, that is unlawful or harassing.  Like the domestic violence protection order, it is a two part process.","

Services include: assistance in filing for temporary domestic violence protection orders, information and referral to social service agencies, domestic violence information, advocacy, court preparation and accompaniment to full order hearings.  A DV protection order is a two part process which includes the filing of a temporary order and then a full protection order entered approximately 14 days later, if granted by the court.

Temporary Domestic Violence Protection Order: 
A civil order that restrains the abuser (respondent) from committing further acts of assault or violence against the person who has been victimized (petitioner). The petitioner (person seeking protection) must fill out a packet of forms that include providing a description of the acts of domestic violence that have occurred and the protections they are seeking.  They will be asked to describe the most recent incident of domestic violence or fear of imminent harm and a history of any other incidents of domestic violence.  Upon filing, the Petitioner should be prepared to provide the respondent's home and/or work address and birth date to help ensure that Law Enforcement can enter and serve the order on the respondent.  A judge or commissioner will review the paperwork, ask questions, and decide whether or not to grant the temporary order (for 14 days). 

Full Domestic Violence Protection Order: 
An order that is granted after the court determines by a ""preponderance of evidence"" that domestic violence has occurred.  At the full hearing, the Judge will give both parties (petitioner and respondent) the chance to talk about the allegations of domestic violence and whether the order should be granted or not.  The full order can be in effect for one year or longer, in some cases.  The process to obtain the full order may last for two to four hours, but the actual full hearing itself may only be about 15 to 30 minutes.

Any time prior to the expiration date, the petitioner may return to court and request that the order be modified (to be made more or less restrictive) or terminated. The petitioner may also request a renewal of the full order up to three months before its expiration date.

Other Types of Orders: (program does not provide assistance on these orders)

Criminal No Contact Order: This order is issued by the court in a criminal case involving domestic violence. An arrest or charges must be filed against the abuser for this type of order to be entered. If charges are pending, contact the court that is hearing the case to ensure that a No Contact order is issued.  Sometimes victims of domestic violence have a criminal no contact order AND a domestic violence protection order.

Restraining Order: This type of civil order can only be filed as a part of another family law action, such as: a divorce (dissolution), legal separation, or child custody case. These orders are optional but can be obtained in addition to a domestic violence protection order, if necessary.

Anti-harassment Order: This civil order is for situations involving a ""continual course of conduct"" or pattern of behavior, that is unlawful or harassing.  Like the domestic violence protection order, it is a two part process.","

2167,1069,,,,"Provides advocacy services to victims of domestic violence.  Services include: assistance in filing for temporary domestic violence protection orders, information and referral to social service agencies, domestic violence information, advocacy, court preparation and accompaniment to full order hearings.  A DV protection order is a two part process which includes the filing of a temporary order and then a full protection order entered approximately 14 days later, if granted by the court.

Temporary Domestic Violence Protection Order: 
A civil order that restrains the abuser (respondent) from committing further acts of assault or violence against the person who has been victimized (petitioner). The petitioner (person seeking protection) must fill out a packet of forms that include providing a description of the acts of domestic violence that have occurred and the protections they are seeking.  They will be asked to describe the most recent incident of domestic violence or fear of imminent harm and a history of any other incidents of domestic violence.  Upon filing, the Petitioner should be prepared to provide the respondent's home and/or work address and birth date to help ensure that Law Enforcement can enter and serve the order on the respondent.  A judge or commissioner will review the paperwork, ask questions, and decide whether or not to grant the temporary order (for 14 days). 

Full Domestic Violence Protection Order: 
An order that is granted after the court determines by a ""preponderance of evidence"" that domestic violence has occurred.  At the full hearing, the Judge will give both parties (petitioner and respondent) the chance to talk about the allegations of domestic violence and whether the order should be granted or not.  The full order can be in effect for one year or longer, in some cases.  The process to obtain the full order may last for two to four hours, but the actual full hearing itself may only be about 15 to 30 minutes.

Any time prior to the expiration date, the petitioner may return to court and request that the order be modified (to be made more or less restrictive) or terminated. The petitioner may also request a renewal of the full order up to three months before its expiration date.

Other Types of Orders: (program does not provide assistance on these orders)

Criminal No Contact Order: This order is issued by the court in a criminal case involving domestic violence. An arrest or charges must be filed against the abuser for this type of order to be entered. If charges are pending, contact the court that is hearing the case to ensure that a No Contact order is issued.  Sometimes victims of domestic violence have a criminal no contact order AND a domestic violence protection order.

Restraining Order: This type of civil order can only be filed as a part of another family law action, such as: a divorce (dissolution), legal separation, or child custody case. These orders are optional but can be obtained in addition to a domestic violence protection order, if necessary.

Anti-harassment Order: This civil order is for situations involving a ""continual course of conduct"" or pattern of behavior, that is unlawful or harassing.  Like the domestic violence protection order, it is a two part process.","

The Commissioners' primary duty is to levy the taxes that operate the county and to adopt a balanced budget for each calendar year. 

Also within their legislative authority capacity, the Commissioners are responsible for adopting, amending and repealing all county ordinances, which are essentially laws of the county. These include traffic, zoning, planning and public safety ordinances, and any other ordinance concerning the general welfare of the county.

County Commissioners have a key role in a wide variety of community boards and commissions, which affect citizens of Pacific County. They also serve on a variety of multi-county boards with other public officials, to direct public policy. 
In their judicial capacity, the Commissioners are often called upon to act as an appeal board to sit in judgment of decisions made by other county officials.

The recording provides information on major outages. Small-scattered outages may not be listed individually.
    *If you hear information on your outage, please hang up.  Donâ€™t leave a message (including questions regarding the cause of your outage or restoration time) if we already know about your outage, because it can cause delays in restoring power.
    *If you donâ€™t hear information about the outage you are experiencing, enter your home phone number when prompted by the system. The number you enter must match the phone number you provided as part of your account information with the Grays Harbor PUD. Please do not enter cell phone numbers or other phone numbers unless they are associated with your account at the outage address.

It will also help if you have important information such as the names of people involved with the problem, and their addresses and telephone numbers.

Based on the vocational goals of the participant, our professional job developers seek out employment situations that meet the specific needs of the individual. In many cases, jobs can be discovered after an analysis indicates that certain tasks can be grouped together to establish a position that meets the particular skills and strengths of the participant. For example, a business may have an office environment in which employees must do their own copying. By setting up a position that enables copying to be accomplished for the entire office, an individual who might once have been seen as having limited skills can learn to perform the duties. This becomes a time-saver for the organization and enables other employees to be more efficient in their primary responsibilities a win-win situation for everyone.

After a position is secured, skilled job coaches set up a training plan for the new employee. The intensive training phase continues until the employee learns the job and is stable in his or her position.

Training is provided to co-workers to increase their ability to support the new employee. Comments about improvements in work place morale and a greater sense of teamwork among staff members are just some of the favorable remarks weâ€™ve received from employers involved with the Individual Supported Employment program through Morningside.

Once the intensive training phase is completed, ongoing support is provided.

Our process starts and ends with families.

Once a family is selected, we have a family support committee that assists the family throughout the building process and the duration of the loan, which may be 30 years.

Tips to stay cool for Kitsap Dept of Emergency Management

Set your thermostat to 78.  Go higher, if the humidity is low enough and you feel comfortable. Turning a thermostat down to cool a room quicker doesn't work, by the way -- it makes the a/c run longer, not colder. 

Wear short-sleeved, loose clothing.  You dress lightly to go out on a summer day. Do the same indoors. Absorbent, wickable cotton (organic, of course!) is the hot weather classic. 

Drink lots of water. This is good practice, anyway. Cold drinks drop your body's core temperature and cools you down quickly.

Add more wetness. Wear a wet rag on your neck, a bandanna on your head, a wet t-shirt. As the water evaporates it will help cool you more effectively. Water has an amazing ability to remove heat, why else do you think they use it to cool power plants.

Take a cool shower, but not a cold one. If you take a cold shower your body will react by shivering which is trying to keep you warm. If a shower is not practical, pans or buckets of water for hands and/or feet help a lot too.

Draw your drapes. Keeping you blinds, shades, and curtains closed -- particularly on the west side of the house -- helps keeps heat from getting inside in the first place.

Turn off unnecessary heat-producing devices. Incandescent light bulbs are a big heat generator. Shut down electronic gear when you're not using it. 

Use the microwave. Conventional cooking dumps heat in the house, but microwaves cook the food directly. 

Wash and dry clothes when the day is cool. Do laundry early in the day and late at night. Don't forget clotheslines: they generate no heat in the house. 

Skip your dishwasher's dry cycle. Rack your dishes and let them air dry, instead. 

Open the bathroom window when showering. Vent heat and humidity outside, rather than back into the house. Obviously, you don't want to put on a show for the neighbors. If you have privacy concerns, open up after dressing. Keep the bathroom door closed. 

Run your air conditioner fan on low, if it's settable. Particularly helpful in high humidity. the low air volume helps your a/c dehumidify. 

Keep heat-producers away from your thermostat. Don't allow a closely located TV or water heater to convince your thermostat that it's hotter than it really is.

Check your refrigerator settings. The fridge takes heat out of your food and transfers it to your kitchen, so be sure you're running efficiently. The refrigerator is best set between 37 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Put the freezer around five degrees. 

Close the fireplace damper. Don't send cool air up the chimney. If your fireplace has a glass door, shut it.","No restrictions.",,None.,,"Walk in duing business hours.",,,,"Cooling Center",,Kitsap,active,,http://www.piersystem.com/external/content/document/1082/2551142/1/Here%20is%20a%20Great%20List%20fo,"T,TH,TH-2600,TH-2600.1900,TH-2600.1900-180"

Tips to stay cool for Kitsap Dept of Emergency Management

Set your thermostat to 78.  Go higher, if the humidity is low enough and you feel comfortable. Turning a thermostat down to cool a room quicker doesn't work, by the way -- it makes the a/c run longer, not colder. 

Wear short-sleeved, loose clothing.  You dress lightly to go out on a summer day. Do the same indoors. Absorbent, wickable cotton (organic, of course!) is the hot weather classic. 

Drink lots of water. This is good practice, anyway. Cold drinks drop your body's core temperature and cools you down quickly.

Add more wetness. Wear a wet rag on your neck, a bandanna on your head, a wet t-shirt. As the water evaporates it will help cool you more effectively. Water has an amazing ability to remove heat, why else do you think they use it to cool power plants.

Take a cool shower, but not a cold one. If you take a cold shower your body will react by shivering which is trying to keep you warm. If a shower is not practical, pans or buckets of water for hands and/or feet help a lot too.

Draw your drapes. Keeping you blinds, shades, and curtains closed -- particularly on the west side of the house -- helps keeps heat from getting inside in the first place.

Turn off unnecessary heat-producing devices. Incandescent light bulbs are a big heat generator. Shut down electronic gear when you're not using it. 

Use the microwave. Conventional cooking dumps heat in the house, but microwaves cook the food directly. 

Wash and dry clothes when the day is cool. Do laundry early in the day and late at night. Don't forget clotheslines: they generate no heat in the house.

Tips to stay cool for Kitsap Dept of Emergency Management

Set your thermostat to 78.  Go higher, if the humidity is low enough and you feel comfortable. Turning a thermostat down to cool a room quicker doesn't work, by the way -- it makes the a/c run longer, not colder. 

Wear short-sleeved, loose clothing.  You dress lightly to go out on a summer day. Do the same indoors. Absorbent, wickable cotton (organic, of course!) is the hot weather classic. 

Drink lots of water. This is good practice, anyway. Cold drinks drop your body's core temperature and cools you down quickly.

Add more wetness. Wear a wet rag on your neck, a bandanna on your head, a wet t-shirt. As the water evaporates it will help cool you more effectively. Water has an amazing ability to remove heat, why else do you think they use it to cool power plants.

Take a cool shower, but not a cold one. If you take a cold shower your body will react by shivering which is trying to keep you warm. If a shower is not practical, pans or buckets of water for hands and/or feet help a lot too.

Draw your drapes. Keeping you blinds, shades, and curtains closed -- particularly on the west side of the house -- helps keeps heat from getting inside in the first place.

Turn off unnecessary heat-producing devices. Incandescent light bulbs are a big heat generator. Shut down electronic gear when you're not using it. 

Use the microwave. Conventional cooking dumps heat in the house, but microwaves cook the food directly.
