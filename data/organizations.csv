Mediation requires that the individuals in dispute be willing to express their concerns openly and honestly, and also consider the concerns of the other people in the dispute.  Mediation encourages collaboration between the parties so that creative solutions can be explored and lasting solutions can be found.  The process is effective in both legal situations where a lawsuit has been filed and in circumstances where a non-legal approach is preferred.  It is a non-adversarial, respectful and flexible process.
